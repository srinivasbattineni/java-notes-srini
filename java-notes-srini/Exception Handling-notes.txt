Exception Handling
====================

Exception
-------------

==> An Abnormal event occurs during the execution of the application which disrupts  the normal flow of the java program in execution.

 When JVM rules are violated, we will get an exception
 When Exception Raised application terminated abnormally and abnormal termination of the application causes the followings issues.

	1) user may lost the work/data
	2) user doesn't have information about what went wrong
	3) resources given to the application can not be gracefully released.

Exception Handling
=================

Exception handling is a mechanism of dealing with exceptions and preventing damages which are caused by the exceptions.

Exception handling makes java as Robust


note : A Robust language refers to language that is reliable , error- resistant and able to handle the exceptions or unexpected situations gracefully.


How does java supports Exception Handling
=============================================

Java supports the Exception handling by using below keywords

try, catch, finally, throw, throws


ex :  

public class ExceptionHandlingDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		int i=10;
		
		String s=null;
		
		int [] arr= {12, 13,14};
		
		System.out.println("Srinivas");		
		
		try {
		
	//	System.out.println(i/0);
		
		System.out.println(arr[3]);
		
		
//		System.out.println(s.length());
		}		
		
		catch (ArithmeticException e) {
			// TODO: handle exception
			
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		
		catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
			// TODO: handle exception
			
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		
		catch (NullPointerException e) {
			// TODO: handle exception
			
			e.printStackTrace();
		} 
		
		catch (Exception e) {
			// TODO: handle exception
			
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		
		System.out.println("Hello");

	}

}


try block
=========

==> try is a keyword which is used to create block of code in java.

==> we use try block to write risky code

==> If any exception raised in try block, instead of program termination try block get terminated.


ex try{

  //risky code
}


catch block
==============

==> catch is a keyword which is used to create block of code in java.

==> catch block is used to handle the exceptions

==> we handle all the exceptions in catch block hence catch block is a exception handler.


******Between try and catch block no code is allowed *********

=> If any exception raised in try block, control always will go to catch block and one try block will associate with multiple catch blocks


Exception Hierarchy
=========================


java.lang.Throwable is the super class of all exceptions


It has 2 sub class

1) Exception 

2) Error


java.lang.Exception is divided into 2 types 

1) Checked Exception   2) Unchecked Exception


1) Checked Exception
=====================

The Exceptions which are checked by the java compiler is called checked exceptions.

we can say checked exceptions are compile time exceptions

ex: IOException, SQLException EOFException(EOF--EndOfFile), ServletException


2) Unchecked Exception
=====================

The exceptions which are not checked by the java compiler, and we will get the exceptions at runtime are called un-checked exceptions.

The exceptions which are checked by the JVM during runtime of java program are called runtime exceptions or un-checked exceptions.


ex: ArithmeticException, NPE(NullPointerException), AIOOB(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException)

====================================
Explain about "throw" keyword.
====================================

"throw" is the keyword in java exception handling and which is used to raise the exception explicitly in java program.

we can raise a either predefined exception or custom exception by using throw keyword

ex: throw new ExceptionType("error message");


public class ThrowKeyWordDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		
		int age=17;
		
		if(age<18) {
			
			throw new ArithmeticException("Age must be above 18 years ");
		}
		else
			System.out.println("Eligible for vote");
	}
}

finally block 
============

==> "finally" is one of the  keyword in java exception handling and it will be always executed.

==> "finally" block is used to place the cleanup code such as closing files, releasing resources, and disconnecting DB connections.

==> generally, we use to write "finally" block after catch block 

ex : try{
	//code that throw an exception
	}

	catch(){

	//code that handle the exception
	}
	finally{
	// code that always will execute 
	}

//try block can be followed by finally block

		try{
	//code that throw an exception
	}
	
	finally{
	// code that always will execute 
	}


public class FinallyBlockDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		
		int i=10;
		
		try {
			System.out.println(i/0);
			
		} catch (Exception e) {
			// TODO: handle exception
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		
		finally {
			System.out.println("finally");
		}
	}
}

throws keyword
===============

==> "throws" is one of the keyword in exception handling which is used to declare the exceptions at method level.

==> we can specify multiple exceptions by using throws keyword.

ex :  psvm(String...args) throws SQLException, IOException, CloneNotSupportedException{

//method implementation

}

public class CheckedExceptionDemo implements Cloneable {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws CloneNotSupportedException {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		
		CheckedExceptionDemo demo=new CheckedExceptionDemo();
		
		System.out.println(demo.hashCode());
		
			Object obj=demo.clone();
			
		System.out.println(obj.hashCode());
			
	}
}

Custom Exceptions or User Defined Exceptions
=============================================

==> In Java, We can create the exceptions by our own by extend the RunTimeException or Exception class is called as Custom exceptions or user defined exceptions

==> To provide meaningful messages to end users we create the custom exceptions and to improve the readability and maintainability of code.

 class UserNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {
		
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

	public UserNotFoundException(String msg) {
		
		super(msg);
	}
}
 
 public class CustomExceptionDemo{
	 
	 public static void main(String[] args) {
		 
		 String user="Srini";
		 
		 String user1="Arun";
		 
		 if(user.equals(user1)) {
			 
			 System.out.println("User Found");
		 }
		 else {
			
			 throw new UserNotFoundException(user1+" User not found");
		}
		
	}
	 
	 
 }
