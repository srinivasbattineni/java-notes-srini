
Variables
-------------

-> Variables is like a container which is used to store the data

		ex: name----srini
		    age=30
		    gender=m
		   isStudent=false
		   mysalary=400.00

-> We need to specify the type of variable to store the data
-> To specify the type of data we use 'data types'


data types
-----------

-> data types are used to specify the type of data we are storing in a variable

-> data types are divided into 2 types

1)primitive/predefined-data types

	1) Integral data types
		a) byte
		b) short
		c) int
		d) long

	2) decimal types

	3) Character types

	4) Boolean types

2) Non-primitive /Referenced types 



1) Integral data types
========================

-> Integral data types are used to store the numbers without decimal points

-> we can store both positive numbers and negative numbers by using integral data types


 ex: age=30
   
 phNo=12345678909

 studentCnt=40 

accountBalance=-4000

-> In this category we have 4 data types

1) byte-----> default value is 0-------> 8 bits
2) short----> default value is 0------> 2 bytes
3) int-----> default value is  0------> 4 bytes

4) long---->default value is 0l-------> 8 bytes


Decimal data types
======================

-> Decimal data types are used to store the numbers with decimal points.

-> we can store both positive numbers and negative numbers by using decimal data types


	petrol price= 107.567465
	stock price= 6678.54
	percentage =90.9
	weight	   =5.9

-> In this category we have 2 data types 
		
			1) float ---->4 bytes----> up to 6 decimal points
			2) double ---->8 bytes----> up to 15 decimal points

Character data types
======================

-> Character data type is used to store single character

-> Any single character(alphabet/digit/special character) we can store using the 'char' data type

-> char data type will occupy 2 bytes of memory

-> when we are storing the data into chat data type ''(single quotes) is mandatory.

-> default value is 'u0002'


ex: gender= 'm'   rank='1'


Boolean data type
================== 

->It is used to store the true/ false values
-> it will occupy 1 bit of memory

note: 8 bits= 1 byte

ex: isStudent
    isPass
    isEven
    isMarried



Variables example
=================

-> To store the data into variables we need to perform 2 steps

		1) variable declaration
			
			byte age;

		2) variable initialization 
			byte age=30;

class VariablesDemo{

public static void main(String[] args){

int  age=30;
float price=107.67f;

double stockPrice=678.542878;

char gender='M';

Boolean isMarried=true;


System.out.println("age = "+ age);

System.out.println("price = "+ price);

System.out.println("stockPrice = "+ stockPrice);

System.out.println("gender = "+ gender);

System.out.println("isMarried = "+ isMarried);

}

}

Identifiers
================


All java components requires a name. For variables, for classes and for methods we need a name

int age;

class Hello{

//code
}

main(){
//code

}

--> The name which we can use for packages,  classes, variables and methods  is called identifier

--> we can use any name as identifier but we need to follow below rules to work with identifiers.


Rule-1
------  

java program will allow below characters for identifiers

		1) a - z
		2) A - Z
		3) 0 to 9
		4) $ (dollar)
		5) _ (underscore)

ex:  name-----valid identifier
     name@----invalid
     age#-----invalid

Rule-2
--------

Identifiers should not start with digit(first character shouldn't be a digit)


	ex: 1age-------> invalid
	     age3------> valid
	   _name-------> valid
	   $name-------> valid
	    @name-------> invalid

Rule-3
-------

	We should not use java keyword as identifier(53 key words)

		int  byte =20; ---invalid because byte is a keyword
       		byte for=30;  ----invalid because for is a keyword
		int try=40;   ----invalid because try is a keyword

		long mobileNo=1234567890;

Rule-4 
------

		spaces are not allowed in identifiers
		
		int mobile bill=500;----invalid
		int mobileBill=500;-----valid

Rule-5
------
java is a case sensitive language 'name' and 'NAME' both are not same.


java naming conventions
-----------------------

-> Java language follows some standard naming conventions for predefined packages, classes and methods


naming conventions for class name
----------------------------------

A class name contains any number of word without spaces

It is recommended to write every word first character as upper case in class name


ex: class Hello{},   class HelloWorld {},  class UserManagementService {}

note: class names and interface naming conventions are same.



Variable naming conventions
-----------------------------

A variable name contains any number of words without spaces.

It is recommended to write first word first character as lower case and other words first character in upper case.


int age;

int userAge;

long creditCardNumber; 



Method naming conventions
--------------------------

A method name contains any number of words without spaces.

It is recommended to write first word first character as lower case and other words first character in upper case.


ex: main(){}    saveUser(){}      getEmployee(){}   getCreditCardNumber(){}


note: variables and method naming conventions are same.


Naming conventions for constants
================================

-> constant means fixed value (values will not change)

-> its recommended that to write all constant variables in upper case, if constant variable contains multiple words its recommended to use _ to separate the words


final int MIN_AGE=18;

final int MAX_AGE=60;


Naming conventions for packages
==================================

A package name contains any number of words without spaces.

it is recommended to use only lowercase letters in package names

If package name contains multiple words we have to use .(dot) to separate the words


ex: com.sriniit.java.corejava
    org.sriniit.j2ee.servlets

	java.lang
	java.io
	java.util

java keywords
=============================

java keywords are reserved words that have special meaning to the java compiler. we can not use keywords as identifiers.

Keywords are used to define, data types, control flow, access modifiers, class/interface and exception handling.
