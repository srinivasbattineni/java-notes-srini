Java Introduction
====================



what is java
-------------

-> Java is a programming language which is used to develop standalone applications, web applications and enterprise applications.

-> Java language developed by Sun Micro system in the year of 1991

-> James Gosling is the lead for the team who developed Java Language

-> The First of java came into market in the year of 1995

Note--Now Sun Microsystems is acquired by Oracle corporation

-> Java is a free software and open source


Java is divided into 3 types
-----------------------------

==>J2SE/JSE---Java Standard Edition-----We use JSE to develop the standalone applications(standalone applications runs on single machine) ex: CALC, Notepad 
==>J2EE/JEE--Java Enterprise Edition---We use JEE to develop the Web applications or Enterprise Applications

Everyone can access web applications using internet 
ex: Gmail, YouTube, Facebook, Naukri, irctc...etc 

==>J2ME/JME--Java Micro/Mobile Edition---We use JME to develop the Mobile Applications  

ex: watsapp, messenger, phonepay, Gpay



Java Features
=================

1) Simple--- The Complex Topics of C/C++ are eliminated in java(Operators Overloading, pointers, Memory management)
 
2) Platform Independent---

-> Java Programs we can execute on any machine
-> we use JVM(Java Virtual Machine) to made java as a platform independent
->JVM is responsible to execute/run java programs


3) Robust---   Due to Automatic Memory management and Exception handling we can say Java is Robust(Strong).

4) OOPS(Object Oriented Programming System)----- 

		-> Everything will be represented in the form of objects in java 
		-> Code reusability

5) Multithreaded---  Built-in support for Multithreading to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

6) Architectural Neutral---Byte code is not dependent on any system architecture.


Environment Setup
==================

1) download and install the Java software

		JDK(Java Development Kit)
		JRE(Java Runtime Environment)


2) JDK/JRE/JVM---


JDK--To Develop and execute the java program we need required environment  is called JDK

JRE--I want to run the Java program in Client machine so JRE provides that environment  to run the Java application.

JVM---In JRE, JVM is responsible to run our java program.


Java Program Structure
=======================

1) package statements

2) import statements 

3) class declaration

4) variables declaration or initialization

5) methods


SampleHello.java
-------------------

class Hello
{

public static void main(String[] args){

System.out.println("Welcome to Srini-It-Solution");

}

}

javac is the command to compile the java program(javac SampleHello.java)

java is the command to run the .class file and print the output on console(java Hello)


Translators
-------------

-> It is used to covert from one format to another format

->There are 3 types of Translators available

		1) Interpreter
		2) Compiler
		3) Assembler

-->Interpreter will convert the program line by line

-->Compiler will covert all the lines of the program at a time

--> Assembler will convert the assembler programming languages into machine understandable language.
