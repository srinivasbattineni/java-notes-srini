Introduction of Full stack development
=======================================

Fullstack development = Frontend Development + Backend Development


Frontend: User Interface(UI)

->Clients /users will interact with software application using frontend


Backend: The hidden part of the application which contains business logic

->When user perform some operation on frontend then backend logic will execute to handle the operation.

->The programmer who can develop the Frontend and backend application is called as Fullstack developer. 



Frontend technologies
=====================

HTML, CSS, Java Script, Angular, React JS


Backend Technologies
====================

Java, Python, PHP, .Net , Node JS



Servers
===========

A server is a system or software that provides resources to other programs or devices known as clients.

In the context of java application, A server receives client requests and process them, and send back response(like webpages, data, api)


Web Servers
=============

Web Server handles the HTTP requests and suitable for Servlets and JSP's

ex : Apache Tomcat


Application Servers
======================

Application Servers suitable for the Enterprise Level applications.

Ex: jboss, WebLogic, Glassfish, and WebSphere 

Application servers uses to deploy Banking applications and large enterprise applications.


Database
==========
A Database is an organised collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed and modified. 
it is used to store and retrieve the data efficiently for applications

Types of Databases
==================

RDMS(Relational Database Management System)
==============================================
Store the data in tables in the form of rows and columns and uses SQL(Structured Query Language) to support relationship between tables.

Ex: Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server

No SQL Database
==========================

Store the data into non-tabular format : JSON, key-value, document, graph or column

ex: MongoDB(Document based), DynamoDB(Document based), Redis(key-value store)


Tools
==================

GIT Hub---Code integration 

JIRA---project management/ Bug tracking/ work assignment

Sonarcube---For Code quality checking

Junit----Fir Unit testing

JMeter---For Performance testing

Jenkins--For Deployment(Automated deployment)


Colud
==========

Amazon---AWS
Microsoft---Azure
Google---GCP
Oracle cloud
IBM cloud
VM Ware cloud
Alibaba cloud


Roles and Responsibilities of Fullstack developer
=================================================

1) Understanding the requirements of project

2) Analyze the requirements

3) Design and planning

4) Development of each requirement

5) Unit Testing and code review

6) code integration(git hub)

7) Frontend + backend code integration

8) Deployment, support and maintenance
